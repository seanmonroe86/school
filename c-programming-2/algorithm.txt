Algorithm

INCLUDES:
stdio.h and math.h both required for console printing, e constant, and
pow().

CONSTANTS:
Some constants used to avoid magic numbers, eg. NOERROR, INITIALIZED and
NUMERATOR.
TENSIGS set to 10^-9 to check when 10 significant figures have been
reached with sum term.
NOTFOUND set to 0, used to avoid overwriting the 10-significant-figures
marker each loop after the first.

MAIN:
Assign to a variable the return value of getE function.
Pass that variable to a print function, to print it.

CALCULATING E:
Initialize two variables to track e, one for the beginning of the loop
and one for the end of the loop.
Initialize an accumulator for factorial calculations, and a reciprocal
variable for the accumulator's reciprocal.
Initialize a loop counter to be used for factorial calculations and
tracking when the 10th significant figure is reached.

Begin the do-while loop:
Set the pre-sum term equal to the post-sum term.
Calculate n! by multiplying accumulator ((n-1)!) by the loop counter (n).
Get the reciprocal of n!.
Add the reciprocal to the post-sum term.

If the reciprocal is less than 10^-9, record the current iteration value
to be printed later.

When the reciprocal reaches machine epsilon, 1/n! will be 0, and the
loop is exited.

Print the recorded iteration as being the term when 10 significant
digits have been reached.

Return the calculated value of e.

OUTPUT:
Print the calculated value of e.
Print the constant value of e from math.h, M_E.
